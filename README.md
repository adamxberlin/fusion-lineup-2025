# Fusion lineup 2025

Just a small selection of the most well-known acts performing at Fusion festival 2025.

There are over 1000+ acts, so it can be difficult to navigate them... This is meant to serve as a starting point.

The table is sortable on each column and can be filtered on any field (e.g. genre, act name or other keywords).
